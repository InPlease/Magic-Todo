# Mega - Todo

Thank you for stopping by. This is just a test where I created a TODO aiming to achieve 100% SEO. I hope you enjoy it. Don't forget to check out my GitHub if you want to see better projects :)

## How to run it

This project doesn't have routes with React Router because it's really just a single screen where you can see everything. Adding unnecessary libraries would only make the build heavier.

```node
npm install
```

## If you don't want to run it just visit the website

This is only on dekstop - We can improve optimization the only ones that isn't in green but almost there. </br>
